## Prediction and recommendation of Grocery Products

### Grocery Prediction and Recommendation using Apriori Association Rule Mining

Understanding that a grocery store has a highly complex working system, like managing items in a group with similar items and also placing those groups of items, etc. So, managing all these things requires a high workload which is not suitable for some grocers as they have to hire some people and hence, they earn less profit. This project can be used heavily in daily markets also because as this is a complete software-based product cost will also be less and even though will help in decreasing the complexity of grocery management system and increasing their profits.

We used the dataset created for normal transactions purposes that includes all grocery details like member id and their date wise transaction details to perform the prediction of these frequent item sets using Apriori Algorithm in Association Rule Mining and integrate it in a software application to make it easier for the store manager to access.
